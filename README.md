# Another inConsole Manga Downloader

So, yep, this is one of those projects where you just expose how weird you can be.<br/>
Why making this?, well, i was bored, and also my computer was full of viruses, so i wonder, why not.
<br/>
I started developing this like a year ago, but, back in the days i was not using github so now i'm just going to fix some things, and publish this, so everyone can laugh at me for my otakuness, i deserve it.

## So What Can This Do?

Well, this project uses python, and does a lot of requests, thats like the fundamental.<br/>
Also it makes a document with the images it downloads so you dont have to fucking open the images one by one.

## Required Extensions:

<ul>
    <li>regex python module (i think its name is "re")</li>  
    <li>The Requests Module</li>
    <li>PyPDF2</li>    
    <li>Docx</li>
    <li>OS</li>
    <li>BS4</li>              
</ul>

I hope someone enjoys this, now it's ready.
